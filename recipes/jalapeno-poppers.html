        <p>These jalapeño poppers are creamy in the middle with crispy bacon on the outside. They're easy to make and taste so much better than traditional poppers.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup cream cheese</li>
            <li>½ cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese/li>
            <li>12 jalapeno peppers, halved lengthwise, seeds and membranes removed</li>
            <li>12 slices bacon/li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Mix cream cheese and Cheddar cheese together in a bowl until evenly blended. Fill each jalapeño half with cheese mixture. Put halves back together and wrap each stuffed pepper with a slice of bacon. Arrange bacon-wrapped peppers on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bacon is crispy, 25 to 35 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
